    ----------
    game : `isolation.Board`

    ----------
    data : string
        The name of the search method to use in get_move().

    timeout : float (optional)
        Time remaining (in milliseconds) when search is aborted.  Note that
        the PvP competition uses more accurate timers that are not cross-
        platform compatible, so a limit of 1ms (vs 10ms for the other classes)

        NOTE: If time_left < 0 when this function returns, the agent will

        ----------
        game : `isolation.Board`
            An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
            game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

        time_left : callable
            A function that returns the number of milliseconds left in the
            current turn. Returning with any less than 0 ms remaining forfeits
            the game.

        Returns
        -------
        (int, int)
            Board coordinates corresponding to a legal move; may return
            (-1, -1) if there are no available legal moves.
